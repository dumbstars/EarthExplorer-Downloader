# EarthExplorer-Downloader
This project is a downloader, which automatically downloads latest Landsat 8 image data from EarthExplorer website and stores it in the local file system. Additionally, it also unzips the data downloaded, and erases any older versions of the data. This project has been made compatible with automatic schedulers.
